Connect controller with bluetooth to Raspberry Pi
Run python script on Raspberry Pi Zero

Left joystick UP - Forward
Left joystick DOWN - Backward
Create button or equivalent - Change direction forward/backward
Right joystick LEFT - turn left
Right joystick RIGHT - turn right

DUE TO MAKE DC MOTORS SAFE:
Only forward or only backward movement is possible at a time
and for safety reasons "change direction" button 
is required
